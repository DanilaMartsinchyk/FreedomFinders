Introduction:
[In a few paragraphs totalling about ½ page, introduce the high-level concept of your program. What this looks like depends a lot on what type of thing you are making. An introduction for an application will look different than one for a game. In general, your introduction should address questions like these:
What does your program do? What problem does it solve? Why did you write it?            
What is the story?      
What are the rules? What is the goal?     
Who would want to use your program?    What are the primary features of your program?     


        We chose to program this game because all of us love playing video games, and we wanted to make a game which seemed like it could be the most fun a game could possibly be. Our game is mainly for people who love action-adventure type video games. The description of the game is below.  
You have been captured on an alien planet and are currently being held against your will in a prison. Now it’s up to you to escape from the aliens and make it back home to earth. The aliens have left deadly traps all over the place that you must avoid at all costs. If you happen to touch a trap, you will set off alarms and cause the aliens to find you and place you back into the prison cell again, erasing all your hard work up to that point. Along the way, you will find weapons and other items which you can pick up and use on your enemies to assist you on your journey. These weapons will soon become a necessity as you progress through the map as the only way to get past certain aliens is to knock them out, and ones fists won't be enough.  Aliens have the potential to drop a variety of goodies, some of which can be used to regenerate lost health or others might be extra ammo for your weapon. If a player is extremely lucky, the guards might drop rare weapons which will help progressing to the exit a lot easier. This is an action packed adventure game waiting for you!






Instructions:
[Explain how to use the program. This needs to be specific: 
Which keyboard keys will do what?  Where will you need to click? 
Will you have menus that need to be navigated? What will they look like? 
Do actions need to be taken in a certain order?     


Click Start Game to start playing.
Click Controls to view the controls:Up arrow key - jump,Down arrow key - slide,Right arrow key - move to the right,Left arrow key - move to the left, left click to use the item.

Features List (THE ONLY SECTION THAT CANNOT CHANGE LATER):
Must-have Features:
[These are features that we agree you will definitely have by the project due date. A good final project would have all of these completed. At least 5 are required. Each feature should be fully described (at least a few full sentences for each)]
*  Checkpoints. Saves your progress when touched.
*  Loot that can be picked up and used. The farther you go the better the loot. For example weapons, health, ammo, shield.
*  Traps. When triggered will spawn more guards.
*  Guards. When they touch the player, the player’s hp will decrease and upon reaching 0 the player will be teleported back to the start or the last checkpoint.
* A score counter based off of the distance traveled. This feature will allow the player to see how far they’ve gotten and be able to compare their score with others


Want-to-have Features:
[These are features that you would like to have by the project due date, but you’re unsure whether you’ll hit all of them. A good final project would have perhaps half of these completed. At least 5 are required. Again, fully describe each.]
* A boss. A challenging enemy with lots of health and powerful attacks.
* A coin system with a store. Buy upgrades, ammo, health, shields, or skins.
* A local 2 player mode. Play with your friend on the same device.
* Custom modes, could have extra boss fights or an endless mode with no bosses/mobs and only traps etc.
* A change controls option. If you prefer different controls you can change them in the settings.


Stretch Features:
[These are features that we agree a fully complete version of this program would have, but that you probably will not have time to implement. A good final project does not necessarily need to have any of these completed at all. At least 3 are required. Again, fully describe each.]
*  Multiple levels. After completing the first level enter a second, more difficult level.
*  Cross server multiplayer game mode (played on different devices)
*  A leaderboard. Will show your best scores that will save even if the player closes the game.




Class List:
[This section lists the Java classes that make up the program and very briefly describes what each represents. It’s totally fine to put this section in list format and not to use full sentences.]


* Main
* Player - represents the character the player will be using
* Enemies/Aliens/Guards - represents an enemy that will attempt to kill the player
* Weapons - represents the different weapons a player can use
* Map (background) - represents the background that will create the illusion of a moving player




Credits:
[Gives credit for project components. This includes both internal credit (your group members) and external credit (other people, websites, libraries). To do this:
* List the group members and describe how each member contributed to the completion of the final program. This could be classes written, art assets created, leadership/organizational skills exercises, or other tasks. Initially, this is how you plan on splitting the work.


Danila: Main, Weapons, leader and organizer
Kunal: Player, Enemies, found/created all artwork needed
